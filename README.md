# Seminar paper Spotify Mining

I worked on this project for a seminar at my university. 
The task was to analyse music tracks with some ML-approaches to understand better which features have an influence on the popularity and which expression on this featreus leads to a higher popularity.
The data comes from Spotify provided via Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks (*New Link, old data is not available anymore*)

## Used ML-Approaches

Usage of Scikit-Learn and XGBoost
- Linear Regression
- kNN
- Decicion Tree
- Random Forest
- Boosted Tree (XGBoost)

## Explainable ML
I levereged the SHAP framwork (https://github.com/slundberg/shap) to get a better understanding of the results of the ML-Tools

Note that the paper is in german.
