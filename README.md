# Seminar-Paper Spotify Mining

I worked on this project for an Seminar at my university. 
The task was to analyse music tracks with some ML-approaches to understand better which features have an influence on the popularity and which expression on this featreus leads to a higher popularity.
The data comes from Spotify provided via Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks (*New Link, old data is not available anymore*)

Note that the paper is in german.
